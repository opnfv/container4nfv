----------
 What is Snort?
----------

`Snort <https://www.snort.org/>`_. is an open source network intrusion prevention system, capable 
of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP 
networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching, 
and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer 
overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting 
attempts, and much more.

----------
 What can I do with Snort? 
----------

Snort has three primary uses: It can be used as a straight packet sniffer 
like tcpdump, a packet logger (useful for network traffic debugging, etc), 
or as a full blown network intrusion prevention system.

----------
 How Snort works? 
----------

Snort works with rules. Rules are a different methodology for performing 
detection, which bring the advantage of 0-day detection to the table. 
Unlike signatures, rules are based on detecting the actual vulnerability, 
not an exploit or a unique piece of data. Developing a rule requires an 
acute understanding of how the vulnerability actually works.
